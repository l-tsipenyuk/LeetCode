# string = "String Manipulation in Python"


#String slicing: i.e. print elements from 1 to 10 with step 2 
# print(string[1:10:2])

# We can access the very last element by using negative index -1.
# With negative indexing, enumeration starts with 1 this time, i.e. the very last element has index -1, the last but one -2, and so on...

# We can reverse a string by using [::-1]. 
# This indexation means start at the end of string, end at the start (index 0), and move with step -1 (backward).

# print(string[::-1])
